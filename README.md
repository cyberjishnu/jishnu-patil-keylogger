# 🔐 Keylogger Pro

**Keylogger Pro** is a GUI-based ethical keylogging tool developed for cybersecurity research and educational purposes. Built with Python using `pynput` and `CustomTkinter`, it allows users to monitor keystrokes in real-time, export logs securely, and understand how keyloggers operate to promote better awareness and protection.

> 📄 Developed as part of **Pinnacle Labs Cybersecurity Internship 2025** (Task 2)

## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Real-Time Keystroke Display** in a modern GUI
* ⏱ **Start/Stop Logging** with button control
* 📃 **Export Logs** to timestamped text files
* ⛔ **Offline Tool**: Works entirely without internet
* 📡 **Ethical Use Notice** built into UI

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Technology    | Purpose                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Python 3.8+   | Core Programming Language     |
| pynput        | Keyboard event tracking       |
| CustomTkinter | Modern GUI layout and widgets |
| threading     | Background keystroke listener |
| datetime      | Timestamping exported logs    |

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Launch the app
2. Enter the main interface (displays a warning about ethical usage)
3. Click **Start Logging** to begin capturing keystrokes
4. Keys will appear live in the GUI window
5. Click **Stop Logging** to stop the listener
6. Click **Export Logs** to save all captured keystrokes to a `.txt` file with a timestamp

> All logs are saved in the same folder as the script with a timestamped filename.
