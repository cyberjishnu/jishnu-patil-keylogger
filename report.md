# 🔐 Internship Report – Keylogger Pro

**Intern Name:** Jishnu Dipak Patil

**Internship Title:** Cybersecurity Internship Program 2025

**Project Task:** Task No. 2 – Keylogger Software

**Organization:** Pinnacle Labs

**Project Duration:** June 2025 – July 2025

---

## ✏️ Objective

To develop an ethical keylogging tool for cybersecurity research and awareness. The goal of this project is to help understand how keyloggers operate, how they can be detected, and how users can protect themselves from such threats.

---

## 🔍 Project Description

**Keylogger Pro** is a Python-based GUI application that captures keystrokes in real time and saves them to a secure, timestamped log file. The tool is built using `pynput` for keyboard event tracking and `CustomTkinter` for a modern and interactive GUI. It is designed strictly for educational and research purposes in secure environments.

Users can start and stop logging with simple button controls, view live keystrokes in the GUI, and export logs as `.txt` files. A clear ethical disclaimer is displayed on the interface to emphasize responsible use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Technology    | Purpose                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Python 3.8+   | Core language                |
| pynput        | Keystroke monitoring         |
| CustomTkinter | GUI design                   |
| threading     | Background keylogging thread |
| datetime      | Log timestamping             |

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Launch the application.
2. The GUI shows an ethical usage message.
3. Click **Start Logging** to begin monitoring keystrokes.
4. Keystrokes appear in the GUI in real time.
5. Click **Stop Logging** to pause the listener.
6. Click **Export Logs** to save captured data to a `.txt` file.

> Logs are saved in the same folder with a unique timestamp in the filename.

## 📅 Use Case

**Scenario:** Demonstrating how keyloggers collect keystrokes.

**Input:** Typing "CyberSecurity123" while logging is active.
**Output Log:**

```
